# AlwaysWin
A new executer for every game is out! This doesn't only work for a specific game, EVERY GAME! More releases coming out later!

# Executer language
The language of the executer is very easy. If you want to enable no kill then type this follow command:
<br>
invinciblePlayer()
<br>
<br>
THAT IS HOW THE LANGUAGE IS EASY. If you want to fly around and noclip type this command:
<br>
flynoclip()
<br>
If you want specific fly or noclip, type only the names! **fly(), noclip().**

# Beginning of the executer
Please type **game-name:(game)_hack**. This is used to locate the game.

# Other
More syntaxes coming soon!
A windows form version coming out later!
